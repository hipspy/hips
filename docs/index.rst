Python HiPS package documentation
#################################

.. note::
 
    This package is being developed as part of Google Summer of Code 2017 program. The progress 
    of this package will be updated on this `blog <https://adl1995.github.io>`_ and the student's
    application can be found `here <https://github.com/adl1995/HIPS-to-Py/blob/master/documents/application.md>`_.
    This ``hips`` package is in a very early stage of development.
    We started to work on it in June 2017 and expect to have a first v0.1 release in summer 2017.
    That said, please have a look and try to use it for your applications.
    Feedback and contributions welcome!

This is the documentation for hips.
